# PS2CVDatabase

This is the official database for the PKGI Store for https://www.ps2classicsvault.com/ this won't serve anyone any actual purpose unless you use PKGI or our official PKGI Store App (PKGI Store app v1.03 and higher alrerady have this setup)

This repository allows PS2 CLassics Vault to update their libary without a 10mb limitation and allows us to update the database even if the official domain no longer exists! if your looking into making your own server for PKGI use our official open source code using this link https://github.com/GamerROMInc/ps2classicsvault it has detailed information on how to set your own up, please do not use this database for your server, create your own!
