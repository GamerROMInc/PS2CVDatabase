## PS2 Classics Vault Official Database for the PKGI Store ##

This database serves no use for anyone except PS2 Classics Vault's PKGI Store for the PlayStation(R)3 system. This database was built upon the idea if https://www.ps2classicsvault.com/ official domain goes down, users will still obtain the latest version of the servers database w/out the need of an app update.

This change was implemented in the v1.04b build of the PKGI Store we have provided. If your build is v1.03b or lower you will no longer receive the latest server database updates, but will still receive PKGI Store updates.
